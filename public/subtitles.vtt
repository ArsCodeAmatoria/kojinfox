00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
In construction, safety is everything.

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.000
But what about the events we don't see coming?

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:13.000
The ones that are rare, unpredictable... and devastating?

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
These are Black Swan events — low-probability, high-impact incidents
that traditional safety plans often miss.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Today, we have a new tool to fight the unpredictable:
Artificial Intelligence and Data Analysis.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
By gathering real-time data — from equipment, weather forecasts,
jobsite conditions, and even worker health —

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.000
AI can spot early warning signs that humans might miss.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.500
Instead of reacting after something goes wrong,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
AI helps us predict and prevent.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.500
Spotting patterns. Highlighting vulnerabilities.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.500
And building a stronger safety net.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.000
Imagine receiving a warning:

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.500
'Wind speeds will exceed crane limits within 2 hours.'

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Or: 'High probability of equipment failure detected.'

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.000
That's not just information — that's time to act.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
By combining AI insight with smart planning, we can turn
Black Swans... into near misses.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Saving lives. Protecting projects. Safeguarding reputations.
